Our analyses of stunting incidence assumed that children whose first measurement occurred after birth were assumed to have experienced stunting onset at the age halfway between birth and the first measurement. To assess the extent to which this assumption influenced our estimates, we plotted the distribution of age at first measurement and the age at enrollment. The vast majority of children were enrolled close to birth, and the majority were less than 5 days of age at their first measurement.
