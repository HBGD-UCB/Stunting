In the manuscript, we compared the mean length-for-age Z-score by age and region in our included studies and in Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets from the same countries as those included in our study. Here we present analogous plots including all of the countries from each region. The plots are kernel density distributions of length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) in Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets (dashed lines) and ki cohorts (solid lines). DHS estimates use the most recent survey from all countries in each region. Open circles indicate median LAZ in ki cohorts; closed circles indicate median LAZ in DHS cohorts.
