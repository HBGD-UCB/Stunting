[["monthly.html", "Chapter 9 Analysis with monthly cohorts 9.1 Mean length-for-age Z-score by age 9.2 Age-specific stunting prevalence 9.3 Age-specific stunting incidence 9.4 Linear growth velocity", " Chapter 9 Analysis with monthly cohorts To explore the influence of differing numbers of cohorts contributing data at different ages, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we subset data to cohorts that measured anthropometry monthly from birth to 24 months. In this sensitivity analysis, the mean length-for-age Z-score was higher in Latin America and exhibited less of a downwards trajectory with age. Age-specific stunting prevalence and incidence was slightly lower in Latin America and Asia and slightly higher in Africa. Standard errors were smaller for Latin America because the analyses with monthly cohorts excluded the COHORTS Guatemala study, which had a very high stunting prevalence compared to other Latin American cohorts. 9.1 Mean length-for-age Z-score by age 9.1.1 All eligible cohorts 9.1.2 Cohorts that measured monthly from birth to 24 months 9.2 Age-specific stunting prevalence 9.2.1 All eligible cohorts 9.2.2 Cohorts that measured monthly from birth to 24 months 9.3 Age-specific stunting incidence 9.3.1 All eligible cohorts 9.3.2 Cohorts that measured monthly from birth to 24 months 9.4 Linear growth velocity 9.4.1 All eligible cohorts 9.4.2 Cohorts that measured monthly from birth to 24 months "]]
